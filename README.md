# DEPRECATED

This project has been deprecated and archived, with the C# implementation of
buttplug having moving to an FFI layer on top of buttplug-rs. This new FFI layer
has not been tested with Xamarin, meaning this repo will not see updated based
on new versions of the library.

If we get to a point where Xamarin works with buttplug-rs FFI, implementations
and examples will be hosted in the buttplug-rs-ffi repo:

[https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi/](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi/)

# Buttplug Xamarin Examples

Examples of using Buttplug C# with the Xamarin Bluetooth Manager to
make C# mobile apps for Android and iOS.
